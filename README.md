## Why am I writing this book?

The book arises from my frustration of not finding modern, clear and concise teaching materials that are readily accessible to beginners like me who wants to learn a bit on how to create their own programming language.

The following are my guidelines

> "If you don't know how *compilers* work, then you don't know how computers work" <sup>[1]((http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html?))</sup>


> "If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it" <sup>[2](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en)</sup>
